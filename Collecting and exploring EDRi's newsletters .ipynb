    "Within this notebook newsletters from the European Digital Rights Initiative (EDRi) were scraped. This process is part of the Thesis: Unravelling resistance in the age of the Data Revolution - A Digital Methods approach towards data activism in Europe. This Thesis explores the emergence and mobilization of data activist practices in Europe. In doing so, it delves into the case study of the EDRi. The thesis argues that data activism creates alternative epistemologies of datafication, whereas the development of data activist practices are subjected to the specific context in which they develop. For this reason, the thesis analyses the evolving practices and narratives of the EDRi as a form of resistance against massive data collection and surveillance practices within Europe."

Within the newsletters the EDRi sets the aganda, explain their tactics and topics of concern. Therefore, these newsletters provide a good source for further analysis. The corpus that is created from this process is further analysed using the web tool Voyant. "

This means improving representation in the digital rights field, but more crucially undoing the power structures preventing us from protecting digital rights for everybody. Approaching digital rights through the lens of decoloniality invites us to interrogate how digital space is occupied, the people who are displaced, and the mechanisms of extraction it requires to exist. This process requires extra work, extra care, extra patience, extra humility as we interrogate that what seems natural.\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"news-listing__prompt-surround\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"container\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"news-listing__prompt\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRead more\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</a>\\n</li>\\n\\n<li class=\"grid__item\">\\n\\t<a\\n\\t\\thref=\"https://edri.org/our-work/edrigram-24-march-2021/\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclass=\"block block--card news-listing\"\\n\\t>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AI-Open-Letter_no-corner-522x286.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"news-listing__image\" />\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"container\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"meta-information\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMarch 24, 2021 &#xb7; EDRi-gram | Information democracy | Open internet and inclusive technology | Privacy and data protection\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"news-listing__title\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEDRi-gram, 24 March 2021\\t\\t\\t\\t</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"news-listing__excerpt\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHuman rights mustn’t come second in the race to innovate, they should rather define innovations that better humanity.

       " 'Whilst EU laws say that each of us is innocent until proven guilty, the prevalence of biometric mass surveillance practices across Europe flips this on its head. Each of us is treated as suspicious until ‘proven’ innocent, by often discriminatory and persecutory deployments of systems that never should have been rolled out in the first place.',\n",
       " 'Covid 19 brought the often invisible power of tech into sharp focus as it fostered the digitalisation of our lives forcing us to rely more heavily on technology to meet all our needs. In response, EDRi emphasised that measures taken should not lead to discrimination of any form, and governments must remain vigilant to the disproportionate harms that marginalised groups can face.',\n",
       " 'Some surveillance technologies are so dangerous that they inevitably cause far more problems than they solve. The use of facial recognition and remote biometric technologies in publicly accessible spaces enables mass surveillance and discriminatory targeted surveillance. In such cases, the potential for abuse is too great, and the consequences too severe. We must ban such practices once and for all.',\n",
       " 'The GDPR is still in its infancy, and while it is too soon to consider revisions to the law, EU regulators and decision-makers have the power to improve enforcement and fulfil its promise for vindicating data protection rights and spurring the development of privacy-protecting business models. The past three years hold important lessons for decision-makers and regulators to leverage to deliver on that promise. A lot is at stake.',\n",
       " 'The increasing use of facial recognition and other biometric surveillance technologies – on our streets, in train stations, at protests, at sports matches and even in our global ‘town square’, Facebook – means that our freedom to be anonymous in public spaces, our freedom to just be, really does face an existential threat. The mask is a symbol of resistance against the growing use of mass facial recognition. Get this symbolic merch and support the work EDRi does.',\n",
       " 'The shady AdTech business model used by Big Tech targets mothers who just had stillbirths with baby ads, and serial gamblers who are trying to quit with gambling ads. EDRi is working to create a better digital future, where people are put before profit. Will you donate to us to help make that happen?',\n",
       " 'Issues of non-discrimination and fundamental rights would have to be at the core of the approach to artificial intelligence, rather than considered after competition and industrial policy. A truly people-centred AI regulation would take a step back and acknowledge the inherent harms AI will perpetuate if deployed for certain purposes.',\n",
       " 'Reflecting on the increased challenges to our digital rights, we realised how imperative it is that the field truly reflects everyone in European society. This means improving representation in the digital rights field, but more crucially undoing the power structures preventing us from protecting digital rights for everybody. Approaching digital rights through the lens of decoloniality invites us to interrogate how digital space is occupied, the people who are displaced, and the mechanisms of extraction it requires to exist. This process requires extra work, extra care, extra patience, extra humility as we interrogate that what seems natural.',\n",
       " 'Human rights mustn’t come second in the race to innovate, they should rather define innovations that better humanity.
